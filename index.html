					<h2>Skateboarding</h2>
					<p>The skateboard was invented in the late 1940s but didn’t become popular 
					since the early 1990s. Since then, the extreme sport has been making strides towards 
					better ways to control the ways to ride the board. From different wheels, board decks and 
					trucks (the part that connects the wheels to the board). Everything to go faster, jump higher 
					or have more control while skating. Over the years there have been new technologies developed 
					for either competition or just a fun way to get around on the street.

					<h2>BMX</h2>
					<p>BMX bikes have been around since the 1970s. They were inspired by motocross bikes. 
					So, people who couldn’t ride yet could experience the dirt tracks on their own. But later 
					it developed itself into its own sport. Since then, there have been major strides in BMX bike 
					technologies. Mainly focused on materials the make the bike lighter yet keep it as durable is 
					possible. Also tires and shocks have been improved for the most grip on the track.

					<h2>Mountainboarding</h2>
					<p>In the 1990s a new way to use a board was invented. Snowboards are usually limited to winter sports 
					seasons or specialized winter sport tracks halls. 
					But with mountainboards people can now board downhill on dirt tracks or any other place outside 
					It requires more durable boards and shock resistance for the wheels. With gaining 
					popularity and competitions the technology for mountainboards have been making major strides. 
					Focusing mainly on speed, control, and durability. And because the sport is a bit younger than 
					other extreme sports the companies are still experimenting with materials.
